			<li>
				Per University guidelines, masks must be worn at all times, inside all library locations, by everyone
				regardless of vaccination status.
			</li>
			<li>
				Libraries, like all buildings on campus, have reduced occupancy limits – once the limit is reached,
				entry is on a one-in, one-out basis.
			</li>
			<li>
				As of September 30 some Pitt ID cards will be expiring which will prevent you from renewing your items.
				To solve this, please contact Panther Central to renew your ID (can be done remotely).
			</li>
			<li>
				Group study rooms are once again reservable, with reduced maximum occupancies. Please note that Bradford
				Hanley Library does not have group study rooms available at this time. Hillman Study rooms will be
				reservable starting on January 19. Study rooms at Langley and Regional libraries will remain as
				first-come, first-served.
			</li>
			<li>
				Access to library spaces is limited to Pitt faculty, students, and staff with a valid Pitt ID. View our
				current hours.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you have a special borrower card, you may request materials via our no-contact pickup services.
				Please visit our website on library access for Special Borrowers for more information about this
				service.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you are a visiting researcher not affiliated with Pitt, you may access Archives and Special
				Collections by scheduling an appointment. To request an appointment, please follow the instructions
				further down this page.
			</li>
			<li>
				Masks must be worn at all times, so no food or drink is permitted in the libraries. The Cup and Chaucer
				café at Hillman Library is closed at this time. Food from the Hanley Library Café must be consumed
				outside the library space.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The Hogwarts Library book drop is open.</strong> Please return your items via the book drop
				rather than bringing them into the Library. Directions are provided further down this page.
